This mobile app was created as a semester-long team project for a class in my final semester of college. While I may continue working with this app, all future changes will be on a separate repository.

This project stemmed from the VaultBuddyDesktop app, created by me for a separate class. The other projects I worked on during this time(VBDesktop, Project Family) did help with getting started but nothing could have prepared me for what a huge undertaking this app turned out to be. 

While developing VaultBuddyMobile, I learned how to work with oAuth2.0 and use the API in a completely different way than I had previously. I also learned about MVVM architecture, async coding, XAML, agile project management, mobile app development, and so much more. 

Although the app still needs work, I can honestly say that the journey of creating VBMobile has been so rewarding and I am very proud of what it became in the short time we were working on it. At this point in the app's development, the only thing keeping it from public distribution is an issue with how it accesses the manifest and my own personal stubbornness. I'd like to display more information, learn more about async coding, and add a few other finishing touches before it's seen by the public eye. 

*If you would like to download and run the app, please contact me directly. There are 2 key pieces of information missing from both VaultBuddy apps(APIKey and Manifest).*
